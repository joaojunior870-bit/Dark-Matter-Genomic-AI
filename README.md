# 🧬 Dark Matter Detector: lncRNA Classification with AI

**Developer:** João Paiva | Bio-Undergrad & AI Student
**Status:** Prototype Complete

## 🎯 The Mission
The human genome is full of "Dark Matter" (non-coding RNA) that holds the key to new therapeutics.
This project uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to distinguish between protein-coding genes (mRNA) and non-coding regions (lncRNA) based on sequence patterns (k-mer analysis).

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3
* **Biology Logic:** K-mer sequence analysis (simulating biological feature extraction).
* **AI Model:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier).
* **Data Processing:** Pandas & NumPy.

## 📊 Results
The model achieved high accuracy in distinguishing coding vs. non-coding sequences, demonstrating that AI can effectively pattern-match genomic syntax.
